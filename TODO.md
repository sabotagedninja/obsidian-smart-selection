Expand / Shrink Selection â†’ common terminology used in IntelliJ, VS Code.



TODO

- rename the plugin folder > remove the "BETA" part
- rename parts in manifest.json: 
    {
        "id": "obsidian-selection-expander",
        "name": "Selection Expander"
    }
- maybe rename plugin to "Smart Selection"
